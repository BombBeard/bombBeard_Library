/*********************  Welcome  **************************
 *	This library is a combination of example code for 
 *	beginners and other various code that I felt may 
 *	benefit others. 
 *	
 *	This library will be updated over time as I work my way
 *	through basic concepts in programming and on to more 
 *	complex code. A basic roadmap for this library is 
 *	provided in "roadmap.txt". I reserve the right to alter
 *	this plan as I go, but will stick to it as best I can.
 *
 *	If you have requests or comments you can email me at 
 *	bombbeard@gmail.com though I can't promise a response.
