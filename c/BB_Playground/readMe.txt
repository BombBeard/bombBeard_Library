 Welcome to my nightmarish playground. Here you will find half completed mini projects and code used to better understand unfamiliar functions. This is left in for two reasons:
	1. Laziness.
	2. Seeing another perspective on how to play with unfamiliar concepts may be helpful.
	
Code from this section may get polished and moved to the exampleCode section, but until then this section is considered a "at your own risk" sort of thing.
